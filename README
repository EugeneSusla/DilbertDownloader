A simple Dilbert comic strip downloader utility, that makes it possible to enjoy Dilbert comics offline.

While originally created using java standard libs only, after about a year this project was revisited 
and tweaked significantly, mainly for self-educational purposes, involving maven, git, log4j, etc.

Usage:
- Cpecify a folder in config.properties, where the strips should be downloaded (targetFolder entry)
- Launch the app
- If interrupted, it will resume from where it stopped the next launch
